1. Find the top 5 users with the highest number of posts.
user_id    num_posts
10         10
9          10
8          10
7         10
6          10

2. For each of these top 5 users, calculate the average post length.
user_id  avg_post_length
6        147
7        163.5
8        160.6
9        154.6
10       154.7

3. Identify the day of the week when the most `lengthy` posts are created (assume all posts were created in the UTC timezone).
day_of_week
Wednesday
